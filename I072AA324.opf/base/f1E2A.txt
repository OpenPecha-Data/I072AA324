Some doomed to die for the sake of skin or flesh, some for their horns or hair or bones or wings,1127. Others torn or kil
led in mutual conflict, friend or relative before, contending thus;

(some) burthened with loads or dragging heavy weights, (others) pierced and urged on by pricking goads,1128. Blood flowin
g down their tortured forms, parched and hungry--no relief afforded;

then, turning round, (he saw) one with the other struggling, possessed of no independent strength;1129. Flying through ai
r or sunk in deep water, yet no place as a refuge left from death.

He saw, moreover, those, misers and covetous, born now as hungry ghosts,1130. Vast bodies like the towering mountain, wit
h mouths as small as any needle-tube, hungry and thirsty, nought but fire and poison’d flame to enwrap their burning for
ms within.

1131. Covetous, they would not give to those who sought, or duped the man who gave in charity, now born among the famishe
d ghosts, they seek for food, but cannot find withal.1132. The refuse of the unclean man they fain would eat,

but this is changed and lost (before it can be eaten); oh! if a man believes that covetousness is thus repaid, as in thei
r case,1133. Would he not give his very flesh in charity even as Sivi râga did!

Then, once more (he saw), those reborn as men, with bodies like some foul sewer,1134. Ever moving ’midst the direst suffe
rings, born from the womb to fear and trembling, with body tender, touching anything its feelings painful, as if cut wit
h knives;

1135. Whilst born in this condition, no moment free from chance of death, labour, and sorrow, yet seeking birth again, an
d being born again, enduring pain.
