657. And now the royal teacher (Purohita), an illustrious sage, with the chief minister, famed for wisdom, with earnest a
nd considerate minds, both exhorted with remonstrances, the king.

658. ’Pray you (they said) arouse yourself to thought, and let not grief cramp and hold your mind! in olden days there we
re mighty kings, who left their country, as flowers are scattered;

659. ’Your son now practises the way of wisdom; why then nurse (increase) your grief and misery; you should recall the pr
ophecy of Asita, and reasonably count on what was probable!

660. ’(Think of) the heavenly joys which you, a universal king, have inherited! But now, so troubled and constrained in m
ind, how will it not be said, "The Lord of earth can change his golden-jewel-heart!"

661. ’Now, therefore, send us forth, arid bid us seek the place he occupies, then by some stratagem and strong remonstran
ces, and showing him our earnestness of purpose,662. ’We will break down his resolution, and thus assuage your kingly so
rrow.’

The king, with joy, replied and said: ’Would that you both would go in haste,663. ’As swiftly as the Saketa bird flies th
rough the void for her young’s sake; thinking of nought but the royal prince, and sad at heart--I shall await your searc
h!’

664. The two men having received their orders, the king retired among his kinsfolk, his heart somewhat more tranquillised
, and breathing freely through his throat.
